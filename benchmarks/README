How to run the benchmark?
-------------------------

1. First, do a make clean and make
	$ make clean
	$ make

2. Before running the benchmark, run 

	$ ./genRecord.sh

The genRecord generates data for external_cal.

3. Running benchmarks

	$ ./external_cal 6 

Here 6 refers to the number of user-level threads to run. Similarly,

	$ ./parallelCal 6
	$ ./vector_multiply 6

Make sure to test your code with different user-level thread count and measure performance. 
We will test your code for large number (50-100) of user-level threads.

Checking correctness
-----------------------

You can check the correctness of code in the following ways.

1.) For each benchmark, you would see the calculated sum and the verified sum to be the same.

Sample output:

        running time: 1373 micro-seconds
        sum is: 83842816
        verified sum is: 83842816


2.) Disable "USE_MYTHREAD" in mypthread.h and compile the library again before compiling the benchmark. 
The code will use "pthread" library by default.

//#define USE_MYTHREAD 1
